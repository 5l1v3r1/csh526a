Here is my port of BSD C Shell (ver 5.26) from the 386BSD source tree.  
It works well for me, but as this is a first release so your milage may vary.  
While this csh may lack some of the bells and wistles you have come to 
expect from bash or tcsh, it has some advantages:

- Good man page included. (I wish bash had this)
- It works. (I wish my tcsh did)
- About as "standard" a csh as you can get.  Any decent introduction to Unix 
  book has a section devoted to the C shell.
- Weighs in at only 95k.

If you wish to compile the source, you will need gcc 2.3.3 and the new 
4.2 libraries.  (It will compile with gcc 2.2.2d but core dumps on execution).
This release has only been tested with Linux 0.99.2, but should work okay 
with 0.97.3 and above.  It probably requires the 4.2 shared libraries
to run.

If you have any problems that you can isolate, please feel free to contact 
me.  Better still, if you know something about BSD and SysV (POSIX?) 
signals, please take a look at the diffs and let me know if my changes
make sense.  The code was compiled with __USE_BSD_SIGNAL, but other changes
had to be made, particularly having to do with the wait3 system call.  Also, 
a couple of changes were made to glob.c that I am not entirely happy with, 
so if you run into problems with csh not globbing correctly, let me know.

Finally, I am interested in porting the "latest" version of csh to Linux 
(I have 5.34 dated 2/5/92).  In particular, if you know anything about 
"vis.h", please contact me.  I cannot find any information on it.

Enjoy!
